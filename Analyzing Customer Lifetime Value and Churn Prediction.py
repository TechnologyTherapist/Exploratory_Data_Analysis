import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as plt

# Load relevant customer data into a pandas DataFrame
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
customer_data = pd.read_csv("customer_data.csv")

# Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

# Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
# Example: Drop rows with missing values
customer_data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Preprocess the data by transforming variables and ensuring data quality
# Example: Convert categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding
customer_data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(customer_data)

# Step 3: Customer Segmentation

# Utilize clustering techniques to segment customers
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Select relevant features for clustering
features = ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]
X = customer_data_encoded[features]

# Perform clustering using k-means
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
customer_data_encoded["cluster"] = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Step 4: Customer Lifetime Value Calculation

# Calculate the CLV for each customer using appropriate methodologies
# Example: Calculate CLV based on historical transaction analysis
customer_data_encoded["CLV"] = (
    customer_data_encoded["total_purchases"]
    * customer_data_encoded["average_order_value"]
)

# Step 5: Churn Prediction

# Prepare the data for churn prediction
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Select features and target variable
features_churn = ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]
target_churn = "churn"

X_churn = customer_data_encoded[features_churn]
y_churn = customer_data_encoded[target_churn]

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_churn, y_churn, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train a machine learning model to predict churn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Create a random forest classifier
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model's performance
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Step 6: Feature Importance Analysis

# Analyze the feature importance provided by the predictive model
importance = rf_classifier.feature_importances_
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({"feature": features_churn, "importance": importance})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values(by="importance", ascending=False)

# Step 7: Actionable Insights and Recommendations

# Present the findings and insights from the analysis
# Example: Print customer segments, CLV analysis, churn prediction results, and important factors influencing churn
print("Customer Segments:")
print(customer_data_encoded["cluster"].value_counts())

print("CLV Analysis:")
print(customer_data_encoded[["customer_id", "CLV"]])

print("Churn Prediction Results:")
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1-score:", f1)

print("Important Factors Influencing Churn:")
print(feature_importance)

# Step 8: Visualization and Reporting

# Create visualizations using matplotlib or seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Bar plot of feature importance
plt.bar(feature_importance["feature"], feature_importance["importance"])
plt.xlabel("Features")
plt
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.title("Feature Importance")
plt.show()

# You can generate comprehensive reports summarizing the project methodology, findings, and recommendations using libraries like Jupyter Notebook or generating HTML/PDF reports using tools like ReportLab or PDFKit.
# Additionally, you can create interactive dashboards using libraries like Dash or Streamlit to visualize the analysis results in an interactive manner.

# Further code implementation and customization may be required based on your specific dataset and analysis requirements.
