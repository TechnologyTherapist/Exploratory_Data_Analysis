This workflow represents a typical EDA process. Here's a brief explanation of each step:

1. Define Objective: Clearly define the objective and goals of your analysis. This helps focus your efforts and determine the specific insights you aim to derive from the data.

2. Data Collection: Gather the relevant data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or files. Ensure that the data collected aligns with your defined objective.

3. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform tasks such as data normalization, feature scaling, and handling categorical variables.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the dataset using statistical techniques, data visualization, and summary statistics. Gain insights into the data, identify patterns, relationships, and potential outliers.

5. Data Visualization: Create visual representations of the data through charts, graphs, and plots. Visualizations help communicate the findings effectively and provide a clearer understanding of the data.

6. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for your analysis. This involves evaluating feature importance, correlation analysis, and dimensionality reduction techniques to select the features that contribute the most to the objective.

7. Model Building: Develop predictive or analytical models based on the selected features. This step can include techniques such as regression, classification, clustering, or other machine learning algorithms.

8. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. This step helps understand how well the models generalize to new data and make predictions or classifications.

9. Conclusion: Summarize the findings and insights obtained from the EDA process. Provide a clear conclusion and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

Remember that this diagram represents a high-level overview, and the actual EDA process may vary depending on the specific project and requirements.
